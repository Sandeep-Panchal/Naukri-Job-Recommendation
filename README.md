# Naukri-Job-Recommendation

This repository contains the 'Naukri Job Recommendation' project.

Well, recommendation has become necessity in almost all the companies such as E-commerce, job portal, etc. Recommendation, to tell in simple terms, it is to suggest/recommend the user based on user's quality, past action, profile, etc. For example, if I have skills like python, data analysis, statistics, then most probably, I will be recommended with data science related jobs.

We have many approaches for recommendation such as clustering, topic modelling (in case of unsupervised), using distance algorithms like pair-wise distance, cosine similarity, etc. In this project, I have used pair-wise distance for the recommendation of the jobs based on the keywords.
